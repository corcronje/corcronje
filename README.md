## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Having always had an interest in all things technical and it was natural for me to gravitate towards computers and coding. I have since 2001 coded in various programming languages, but have primarily applied myself towards coding robust PHP, and later the Laravel applications. Having built a few Vue, React and React Native apps lured me into the world of JavaScript frameworks and eventually Next.js, which is just brilliant and a framework that I enjoy working with the most.

I currently work as a senior fullstack developer contractor, and previously held various positions as a fullstack developer and team lead.

I have strong technical experience and can able to code in various programming languages and can apply or transition between programming languages and frameworks when required and in support of the company or team. I have leveraged my coding abilities to build numerous products and solutions, and pride myself in not only being a problem solver that can work diligently on a problem towards finding and or building a solution, but also being an awesome and fun team member.
